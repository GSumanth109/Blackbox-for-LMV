# Blackbox-for-LMV
This project is a demonstration of how a blackbox would function in a car. A simple controller would be connected to the ECU unit for logging data. Its also contains protocols for drowsiness detection where the Eye to Ear ratio is measured to check for drowsiness. Potentiometers served as inputs to different parameters in this project.
